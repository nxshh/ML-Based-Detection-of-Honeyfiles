# Breaking the Bait: ML-Based Honeyfile Detection System

Research Project:
A machine learning-based system for detecting **honeyfiles**—decoy documents designed to trap attackers. Using a **Kali Linux–Metasploitable 2** environment, the system analyzes file attributes, metadata patterns, and access behaviors to distinguish real files from decoys in real-time, aiding penetration testers and red teams in accurate security assessments.

## Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest (RF):** Efficient for structured file attributes; interpretable results.  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Detects subtle differences in high-dimensional data.  
- **Autoencoders:** Unsupervised anomaly detection; flags deviations from legitimate file behavior.  

## Key Features
- Automated honeyfile detection.  
- Supports Word, Excel, and text-based decoy files.  
- Enhances penetration testing and red team effectiveness.  
- Research-focused; suitable for cybersecurity experimentation.  

## Technologies
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow  
- **Virtual Machines:** Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2  
- **Tools:** Metasploit Framework  
- **Programming Language:** Python
